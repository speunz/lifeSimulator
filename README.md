# OpenGift 5th free hackathon

##MicroLife simulator

Hello Opengifters!

What about a little game development? Let's try to create something interesting!

There is a smallest life part, a cell. The main goals of our cell are to eat, to divide and to survive. Create a battlefield where your cells will fight with other cells. Follow the conditions in comments.

You need to create a battlefield process visualization. The visualization rules are up to you. For example,  you could draw points on a black background, where the most powerful cell has the brightest color.

Create a battle between at least two teams of cells. Every battle starts on a field with spaces (0) and obstacles (1). On this field 10 cells of each team are randomizely created. Each step of the battle calls "step" method of each cell. On each step a cell decides whether it wants to move, and where it wants to move. Also, on each step any cell can devour a more weak neighbour cell and be divided.

Once hackathon is over, we will conduct a battle between your cell objects. A creator of the most life accommodated cells will win the hackathon!
